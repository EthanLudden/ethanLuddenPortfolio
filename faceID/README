Title: FaceID
Author: Ethan Ludden

Summary:
Face ID is a user verification tool in python. The program scans a user’s face and compares it to a collection of registered faces in the “faces” directory. If the user’s face matches one of the registered faces to at least 90% the user is verified and the frame turns green. Otherwise, the frame turns red.

Registered faces: These faces will cause the frame to turn green
