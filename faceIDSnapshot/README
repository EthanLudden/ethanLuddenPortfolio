Author: Ethan Ludden

Summary:
Face ID Snapshot is a user verification tool in python. The program scans a user’s face and compares it to a collection of registered faces in the “faces” directory. When the user’s face is in the frame, he or she will press the space bar to take a snapshot of his or her face. The user will see his or her snapshot on screen while the verification status is loading. The verification result is displayed for ten seconds.


Registered faces: These faces will cause the frame to turn green
